# Lead changelog

## lead: add Uncanny Valet starter kit
Date: 2026-11-05
Files: CLAUDE.md, docs/design.md, docs/changelogs/*, Assets/_Project/Scripts/Core/*, module asmdefs and
marker files, Assets/_Project/Editor/WebBuild.cs, Assets/_Project/Tests/EditMode/*, .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml,
tools/*, .claude/*
Why: Project skeleton, Core contracts and CI/CD so module agents can work in parallel (design.md sections 9-10).
Tests: EventBusTests (3 tests) to be run in P0.

## lead: add Unity 6000.2.5f1 project and git repo
Date: 2026-11-05
Files: ProjectSettings/*, Packages/*, Assets/Scenes/*, Assets/Settings/*, Assets/DefaultVolumeProfile.asset,
Assets/InputSystem_Actions.inputactions, Assets/UniversalRenderPipelineGlobalSettings.asset, .vsconfig,
.claude/settings.json, generated .meta files, docs/changelogs/lead.md
Why: Create the Unity project (2D URP template, Unity 6000.2.5f1, product name Uncanny Valet) so CI can build the Web player (design.md section 1, 10).
Tests: EditMode run in batch mode: 3 of 3 passed (EventBusTests).

## lead: switch to local Web build published from site/
Date: 2026-11-05
Files: .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml, tools/build-web.ps1, .gitattributes, docs/changelogs/lead.md
Why: Unity CI needs a license tied to a password login, which the project owner does not have. The Web player is now built locally and the committed site/ folder is published to GitHub Pages (design.md section 1, Platform).
Tests: Not run; workflow and script not yet exercised. Needs the WebGL Build Support module before the first build.
