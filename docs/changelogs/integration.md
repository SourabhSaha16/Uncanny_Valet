Entries are added by the integration agent, one per commit. Format in docs/changelogs/README.md.

## integration: add GameBootstrap, overlay, camera and scene builder
Date: 2026-11-05
Files: Assets/_Project/Scripts/Bootstrap/GameBootstrap.cs, CameraFollow.cs, PlaceholderSprite.cs; Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/DebugOverlay.cs; Assets/_Project/Editor/ProjectSetup.cs, BootstrapSceneBuilder.cs, UncannyValet.Editor.asmdef
Why: P2 wiring for the design.md section 10 loop. Editor script creates LotConfig, PatronConfig and Bootstrap.unity (scene 0). Scene not yet generated: Unity batch launch was blocked in this run.
Tests: none run; code not yet compiled in Unity.

## integration: show parking spot in the overlay
Date: 2026-11-05
Files: Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/DebugOverlay.cs, Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/TicketBoard.cs
Why: play-test request; ticket lines show the spot from CarParked/CarLeftSpot events (Core-only). Larger font and dark background, sizes serialized. design.md section 10.
Tests: none run (Unity not launched).

## integration: fit overlay box to its text
Date: 2026-11-05
Files: Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/DebugOverlay.cs, Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/TicketBoard.cs
Why: the fixed-size overlay box covered the curb area. The box now sizes to the measured text (serialized padding) and shows at most 8 ticket lines then "+N more".
Tests: none run (Unity not launched).
