## integration: add GameBootstrap, overlay, camera and scene builder
Date: 2026-11-05
Files: Assets/_Project/Scripts/Bootstrap/GameBootstrap.cs, CameraFollow.cs, PlaceholderSprite.cs; Assets/_Project/Scripts/UI/DebugOverlay.cs; Assets/_Project/Editor/ProjectSetup.cs, BootstrapSceneBuilder.cs, UncannyValet.Editor.asmdef
Why: P2 wiring for the design.md section 10 loop. Editor script creates LotConfig, PatronConfig and Bootstrap.unity (scene 0). Scene not yet generated: Unity batch launch was blocked in this run.
Tests: none run; code not yet compiled in Unity.
